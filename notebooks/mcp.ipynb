    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we will use existing Exchange Rate API service for example the [Exchange-Rate API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/).\n",
    "We choose this because it contains free budget (1,500 API calls) and easy to use.\n",

    "You can [Sign Up](https://app.exchangerate-api.com/) here to get a API Key for making request to get exchange rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "For getting rates based on one currency, you can use following endpoint:\n",
    "\n",
    "`https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/<your_api_key>/latest/USD`\n",
    "\n",
    "(Please replace the `<your_api_key>` with yours)\n",
